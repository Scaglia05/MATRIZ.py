This Python script exemplifies the use of lists and matrices to store and access information about different brands of cars and their top speeds. Here is a detailed explanation of how the code works:

Data Definition: The code starts by creating an empty list called car_list and an array called car_matrix. This matrix contains information about different car brands and their respective maximum speeds.

Extraction of Speeds: Through a loop, the script iterates over each line of the car matrix. At each iteration, the maximum speed of each car is extracted and stored in the listlista_carros.

Sum Calculation: While traversing the matrix, the script calculates the sum of all the cars' maximum speeds. This sum is stored in the sum variable.

Printing Results: After the loop completes, the script prints the following results:

The complete array of cars.
The third row of the matrix, which corresponds to the third car brand listed.
The top speed of the Volvo, which is on the second line of the matrix.
The last car brand reported in the matrix.
The sum of all the maximum speeds of the cars.
This code is an excellent resource for Python beginners interested in learning about manipulating lists and matrices, as well as iterating over these data types. It provides a practical understanding of how to access and manipulate structured information in Python.
